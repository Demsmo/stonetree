                The Indianapolis native, Alec “Casper Merci” Surridge, is a producer, songwriter, and <br />
                engineer. Adopting a do-it-yourself approach to his music, if there is something he hasn’t done <br />
                before, he’ll learn it. <br />
                Casper’s career in music began in early high school when he bought his first laptop and <br />
                began making beats in Logic Pro. His passion and drive have always been solidly rooted in a <br />
                deep love of hip-hop and rap and it shows in his music. In 2022, Casper graduated from the <br />
                Music Technology program at IUPUI where he developed his skills as an artist, producer, and <br />
                engineer. It has been his goal from the beginning to be completely self-sufficient in his creative <br />
                process from beat-making to cutting verses in the booth to mastering the final mix of a song. <br />
                His switch to producing in Ableton, engineering in ProTools, learning bass and guitar, and <br />
                relying on his turn-table and ever growing collection of vinyl allows him to continue to grow in a <br />
                unique and original way as an artist and musician. Book by request only lovehardrecords@gmail.com
